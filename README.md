# airline satisfaction visualization with python
This Python code provides a set of data visualization and analysis tasks for exploring the "Invistico Airline" dataset. The dataset contains information about airline passengers, including details such as gender, age, customer type, type of travel, class, flight distance, and satisfaction ratings.
# what does the code functions do 
The class automatically performs the following data visualization and analysis tasks:

Data summary: Provides an overview of the dataset, including column data types, unique values, and missing values.

Age distribution: Displays a histogram showing the distribution of passenger ages.

Categories distribution: Visualizes the distribution of categorical columns, including 'satisfaction', 'Gender', 'Customer Type', 'Type of Travel', and 'Class', using pie charts.

Categories grouped: Groups categorical columns ('Gender', 'Customer Type', 'Type of Travel', and 'Class') by 'satisfaction' and plots bar charts to visualize the satisfaction distribution within each category.

Rating columns visualization: For columns with ratings from 0 to 5, such as 'Seat comfort', 'Departure/Arrival time convenient', and others, it maps the ratings to descriptive labels ('Not Rated', 'Bad', 'Okay', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent') and plots bar charts showing satisfaction distribution by each rating.

Age groups visualization: Categorizes passenger ages into groups and plots a bar chart showing the satisfaction distribution within each age group.
